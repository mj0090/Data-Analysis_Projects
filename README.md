1.Help_Lives_Healthcare_No_Show_Prediction
<br>
Using Python and Power BI, I analyzed historical healthcare appointments data to uncover patterns influencing not show of patients due to various reasons. A Decision Tree classifier was developed to predict the no show patterns, and a dynamic dashboard was built to allow users to explore appointments vacant insights. The outcome is a model that predicts patients no show reasons or patterns and a visual dashboard with interactive filters and sliders for data exploration.
Tools Used:- Python(pandas, scikit-learn), Power BI(DAX)

2. Airbnb_Dynamic_Price_Engine
<br>
Using Python and Power BI, I analyzed historical Airbnb listings data to uncover patterns influencing listing prices. A regression model was developed to predict optimal pricing, and a dynamic dashboard was built to allow users to explore pricing insights. The outcome is a pricing engine that suggests optimal listing prices and a visual dashboard with interactive filters and sliders for data exploration.
Tools Used:- Python(pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn), Power BI(DAX)
